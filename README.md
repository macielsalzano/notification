# Email Notification Library using phpMailer

This library has the function to send email using the phpmailer library. Making this action uncomplicated is essential for any system.

To install the library, run the following command:

```sh
composer require macielsalzano/composer
```

To make use of the library, just require composer autoload, invoke the class and call the method:

```sh
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

USE Notification\Email;

$email = new Email(2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your-pass", "smtp secure (tls/ssl)", "port (587)",
    "from@email.com", "From Name");

$email->sendEmail("SUbject", "Content", "reply@email.com", "Replay Name", "address@email.com", "Address Name");
```

Note that the entire configuration of sending the email is using the magic constructor method! Once the constructor method is invoked within your application, your system will be able to perform the triggers.
